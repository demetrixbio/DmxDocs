# DmxDocs
Demetrix FSharp coding documentation

## Preface

This is a *subset* of the Demetrix devdocs.  It was written for our internal use to help maintain consistency.  If it happens to be useful for you,  that's a happy coincidence,  but no warranty implied, use at your own risk.   If you like it, let us know!  If you want to improve it, please send in suggestions / additions / changes.   If you want to change our code formatting conventions! that's a different conversation.
